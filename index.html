  <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
  <p>In this project, I worked with 3 team members to conduct a variety user-centered research methods to understand young adults’ perception in the home buying process. We worked with our client-Blend in this project in the way that people from their design and research give feedback and ask questions.
    The project ended with a prototype from insights of speed dating and we tested our idea through experience prototying to make revisions to fit our intended user needs.</p>



  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>Based on our research, we’ve identified two pain points for first-time home buyers. One is there’s a financial barrier for young adults and the other one is the needs to organize the reseach work in the home buying process. 
    Therefore, we are aiming to help first-time home buyers through breaking down the steps and information in a clear and simple way.</p>



  <h3>Methods</h3>
  <p>
    We began our research by recruiting young adults who either had or did not have home buying knowledge to learn more about their needs. In each stage we conducted a variety of research methods that help us generate insight into a young adult’s perception of home-buying, their pain points, and misconceptions.

  <h3>Insights</h3>
  <p>The key insights and takeaways are that young adults need help in learning financial information; they need to keep the whole journey organized to avoid being overwhelmed, and they need personalized advice and guidance at any point in the process.
  </p>

  <h4>Think Aloud</h4>
  <p>
    There is a large abundance of housing information available, however, young adults are not aware of that.
  </p>

  <h4>Speed Dating</h4>
  <p>
    People appreciated having lists of what to do, but the biggest benefit was having a personalized list of what they should do rather than a general guide.
  </p>

  <h4>Contextual Inquiry</h4>
  <p>
    People enjoy a clear process on what to do and want their information to be well organized.

  <p>
    Others who’ve been through the home buying process call it complicated. Many others who haven’t started fear being overwhelmed by the amount of information that they need to research, and that they instead desired personalized advice and plans.
